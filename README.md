# CustomPowerShellModules
This is a Repo that will link to sub-repos by others for working on a bringing a 1 singular module for a given technology to help prevent duplicated code.

Basically - I see that there are lots of modules being worked on by a number of different people and I wanted to get this organised into a singular area where we can collectively collaborate on making the Modules as brilliant as possible.

Please feel free to add to this over time
